                <p>
                    Understanding controversies in online news is crucial for journalists, online social networks, and policy makers. In this research, we present a new metric, Controversy Score, for detection of controversial content in social media. The score employs a statistical approach that infers the controversiality of content from the toxicity of its comments, such that the toxicity distribution approximates either an `M' or `U' shaped distribution. We validate the approach using a dataset of 180,733 YouTube comments from an online news publisher. In addition, we build a predictive model to score controversiality of a news story even when its comments are disabled. Our findings suggest that the most engaging videos are also the most controversial ones. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis of the controversial themes suggests that the framing of the story impacts its controversiality.

This project involved refactoring of the existing code and adding CodeClimate to the repository as well.

                        <p>
                            Developed a Software-as-a-Service which can analyze/interpret the video, trimming relevant
                            part of the video and can also search through video using image or text. This project has 4 pipelines dealing with Trimming the video based on the query,
                            indexing video based on text and making notes of the video, subtitle, and sentimental-analysis online and Video Dubbing using GANS.<br>
